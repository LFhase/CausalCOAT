      "The patient presents with a variety of musculoskeletal and neurological symptoms. She reports experiencing neck pain, right-sided referred pain to the upper thigh (R pta), and sensations of discomfort in the pharyngeal region. Additionally, she exhibits symptoms consistent with right shoulder impingement, as well as unspecified troubles with both left and right shoulders. Lower body complaints are noted as well, including right hip arthritis and left ankle trouble. Collectively, these symptoms suggest a varied presentation that may involve multiple anatomical structures and require a detailed assessment.\n",

The hip pain mentioned is bilateral with a specified arthritis in the right hip, while the left side appears to be less defined in characteristic. Additionally, sciatica symptoms are indicated exclusively on the left side (referred to as ischias), along with pain in the left hamstring and posterior thigh, and tenderness in both Achilles tendons, more notably on the right side.\n",

      "The patient presents with unilateral neck discomfort on the right side, associated with impingement and trouble in the left shoulder, as well as unspecified problems in the right shoulder, contributing to difficulties in upper limb function. There is also a reported discomfort in the left upper arm and problems affecting the left hand. The patient experiences lumbago, with symptoms reported on both sides, although the narrative suggests a predominant right-sided lumbago. The hip pain mentioned is bilateral with a specified arthritis in the right hip, while the left side appears to be less defined in characteristic. Additionally, sciatica symptoms are indicated exclusively on the left side (referred to as ischias), along with pain in the left hamstring and posterior thigh, and tenderness in both Achilles tendons, more notably on the right side.\n",

Specifically, there is discomfort noted in the left neck (L neck problems), with similar difficulties experienced on the right side (R neck). She is suffering from headaches that seem to localize to the forehead (forehead headache) and back of the head (back headache). She also reports trouble with her right jaw (R jaw trouble) and discomfort in the left upper arm. Pain is noted laterally at the left elbow (L lateral elbow pain) and medially on both elbows (L and R medial elbow problems). Wrist and hand issues are present on the right (R wrist problems and R hand problems). In addition, the patient has reported left shoulder trouble, right shoulder trouble, and left-sided obesity. Further musculoskeletal concerns include an issue with the right hamstring (R ham) and tear problems, presumably in the same region, accompanied by left Achilles tendon discomfort (L achillodynia).\n",

The right hand displays positive functionality with the ability to give a thumbs-up gesture. However, right lower arm disorders have been noted along with issues concerning the left hand. The patient is also wearing a band on the right arm, potentially indicating a need for joint support or stabilization. In the lower extremity, symptoms include lumbago, pain in the left hamstring, pain in the right foot, and pain localized to the left posterior thigh.\n",

The patient also reports right lateral elbow pain. His thumbs appear to be in good function with the left thumb displaying a full range of motion (L thumbs up). He has tendinous afflictions, noting left adductor tendon involvement without specification of inflammation, in contrast to the confirmed right adductor tendonitis. A general lower back pain termed lumbago is present, accompanied by left thigh pain and a comparable partial temporary auditory loss on the left side (L pta). Additional joint issues are noted, such as right hip arthritis, problems related to the left big toe, right heel issues, pain in the left posterior thigh, and left achillodynia, indicative of an Achilles tendon disorder.\n",
